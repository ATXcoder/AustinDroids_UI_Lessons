<h1>Fragments</h1>

<p>Google's Android operating system exist on on all kinds of different devices. These devices range from small wristwatches, to glasses, phones, and even large flat screen 
televisions. Because not all devices that Android runs on have the same specs, the operating system has evolved to be flexible and provide developers with tools to help 
create applications that run seamlessly across a number of different devices.</p>

<p>
In this lesson we are going to look at one such tool known as Fragments. Fragments give us the ability to do many things but for our purposes, Fragments are what are going to
allow us to create a dynamic and flexable UI. Google gives us the example of a basic RSS reader. Using Fragments, the application shows the user <b>Fragment A</b> which simply 
displays the list of articles. When the user clicks on an article, <b>Fragment A</b> goes away and <b>Fragment B</b> takes its place displaying the full article.

	Using the same app though installed on a device with a larger viewing area we can see that the app now places the two fragments <b>(Fragment A &amp; Fragment B)</b> next to eachother
	allowing the app to better utalize the full size of the devices viewing area.
